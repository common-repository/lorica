== Description ==

This is the Hello Dolly plugin with the words changed and some variable names too! Wordpress is a great tool and this is a VERY SMALL contribution back to the developers. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!

This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of hundreds of generations summed up in prayer of St Patrick (St. Patrick (ca. 377). When activated you will randomly see a line from <cite>The Lorica of St Patrick</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.
